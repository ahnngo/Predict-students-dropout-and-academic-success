# Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success: Project Overview 
* Created a tool to estimate the risk of dropout and failure based on academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors, with an accuracy of 0.78 (Random Forest), helping to provide more accurate help to students.
* Deployed Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and GridSearchCV to test the accuracy of each model and compare to find the best performance.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset I got was almost ready to use. However, to separate each element in a list, instead of using comma ",", the original dataset uses a semicolon ";", which generated a mistake when I used pandas to read the dataset. Therefore, the only cleaning step I did was to change all ";" to "," by changing extension csv to txt, opening txt file and replacing all ";" to ",".  

## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.

## Choosing Efficient Machine Learning Model

After building Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and GridSearchCV models and testing accuracy, I was able to see that Random Forest perform the best. While choosing the best algorithm, I graphed a chart about Error Rate vs K value in KNN.
